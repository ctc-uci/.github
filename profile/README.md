## 💜 Welcome to Commit the Change's GitHub home!
***We are a student organization at UC Irvine whose mission is to deliver high-quality software for non-profit organizations while giving students meaningful opportunities to develop `tech with purpose`.*** 🚀

Commit the Change (CTC) was founded in early 2020 by a small group of UC Irvine students looking to help nonprofits in the Orange County area, but has since grown into a team of over 70 members, with 15 completed software projects and counting. We were the **Best New Organization** and the winner of the **Outstanding Virtual Service Initiative Award** at UCI's 2020 Anteater Awards, following the completion of our first year as an official student organization at UCI.

## 🤝 Working with Us
Each school year (September to June), we work closely with a small group of NPOs to determine how software can alleviate bottlenecks in their operating procedures, facilitate a new initiative, or otherwise support their mission for social good. Once a project is found, our student design and development teams implement an elegant and user-friendly software solution at low or no cost to the NPO.

### 🧱 Iterative Development
We revise and improve our solutions based on NPO feedback and conduct user testing after all major changes. This ensures that our software will always be tailored to the NPO's wants and needs.

### 📨 Frequent Communication
We provide quarterly updates on projects, respond to emails and questions, and check in with NPOs on major design decisions and project requirements.

## 🔰 Students - Joining CTC & Our Culture

Being part of CTC is a rewarding experience that we hope our members can enjoy with one another while coming together to build tech for social good. We look for passionate, committed UC Irvine students every September who are interested in learning new technical skills by working on projects for NPOs with other like-minded peers!
